# Sudo Stream Tools Chat Client

This project is meant to allow users to create styles and add functionality to the chat overlay's for Sudo Stream Tools.

We will be setting up a system to allow you to create the themes in the near future in the meantime if you want to create a style for the chat message please create a file with the theme name and add it to the themes folder in src. The path should look like this `/src/themes/default.css` with `default` being the name of your theme.

## Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
```
